"""CP1404 Extension and Practice Work
Check files for missing data
The song lyric text files should all have copyright information in them on a line that
starts with .i like:

.i (c) 2011 Thankyou Music (Admin. by Crossroad Distributors Pty. Ltd.)
Write a program that reports the names and directories of all of the files that are missing this line.

--- Version 2 ---

Automatically look up the copyright information from the Internet based on the song title and author,
then add the data to the file...
Good luck with that ;)
Assumes list of files. Not tree of subdirs
This program is designed for multiple directory tree structures.
